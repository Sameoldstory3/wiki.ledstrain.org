#### What is LEDStrain?

The [Forum](https://ledstrain.org/) and Wiki are here to help with the impact
 light-emitting devices have on our health - particularly eye health.  
All are free to use and can use your help!


#### Interested in contributing? 

There are two ways: via a WordPress-like editor, or directly on GitHub. [Details](ledstrain#contributing)

Don't forget: you can embed any forum post directly into a wiki page [via shortcodes](ledstrain#forum-post-embed)! ðŸ™‚
